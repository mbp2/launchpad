# Launchpad

This is the upstream source repository for the Launchpad bootloader project.
Launchpad is an effort to replace the current Trident 3 bootloader called "Springboard", which is
a fork of the [`rust-osdev/bootloader` project](https://github.com/rust-osdev/bootloader).

The aims of this project are primarily to test if Zig is a viable language with which to build a
competant bootloader for the [Trident 3](https://github.com/mbp2/sys3) operating system.

### Extensions

Currently, there is no real way to "extend" Launchpad except by working directly in the source code,
however I plan to begin work on an Extensions API for the bootloader once I have a solid foundation
on which to build.

### Contributing

Contributions from fellow Zig lovers are welcome! Just fork the repository and submit your PRs when
they are ready, fully cooked or otherwise.
